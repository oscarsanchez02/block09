                <h2>Friends</h2>
                <p>Furthermore, Walter even affectionately called him "son". Fans even noticed that the duo 
                    formed a bond when they were at work, almost replicating a father-son relationship. It can 
                    also be said that Walter White Jr. was Walter White's son, but Heisenberg's son was Jesse Pinkman.</p>
